# OtterJet

OtterJet is a project designed to provide a visualization of messages from a NATS JetStream server. Offering a WEB interface for interacting with NATS JetStream servers.
This project is particularly useful for developers who need to monitor traffic during development.

## Prerequisites

- Java 17 or higher
- NATS JetStream server

## Features

- Reads messages from a NATS JetStream server.
- Deserializes messages based on the specified mode (protobuf or plaintext for now).
- Filters messages based on subject, type, and body content.
- Displays monitoring information in a web interface.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run `mvn clean install` to build the project.
4. Configure your NATS JetStream server details in the `application.properties` file.

## Configuration

The following properties need to be set in the `application.properties` file:

- `read.mode`: The mode to use for deserialization (either `proto` or `plaintext`).
- `read.subject`: The subject to read messages from.
- `read.proto.pathToDescriptor`: The path to the protobuf descriptor file (only required if `read.mode` is set to `proto`).

## Usage

After building the project, you can run it using the command `mvn spring-boot:run`.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues while setting up or running the project, please check the following:

- Ensure that your NATS JetStream server is running and accessible.
- Verify that the configuration properties in the `application.properties` file are correct.
